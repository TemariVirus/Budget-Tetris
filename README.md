## Current Plans

- [ ] Build a standalone client that interfaces with the bot via TBP
- [ ] Wrap old bot code in a TBP-compliant API
- [ ] Build some new bots that follow the [Tetris Bot Protocol](https://github.com/tetris-bot-protocol/tbp-spec)
- [ ] Build a [Tetr.io bot](https://github.com/Poyo-SSB/tetrio-bot-docs) so that others can challenge it online
- [ ] Compile client to wasm and run on the web?
